# Simple Factory Pattern

It's assumed that you use this pattern in all software applications you write.

Method and Abstract Factory Design Patterns rely in this pattern.

This Pattern provides a way to do objects instantiations outside of the client app (handled it in background).
This is a way to promote security and maintanible code to our software apps.

In software, a Factory is such an object than can create others Objects.
